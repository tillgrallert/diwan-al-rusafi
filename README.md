This repo holds the beginning of a facsimile edition, serialised as TEI/XML, of *Dīwān al-Ruṣāfī: wa-huwa majmūʿ mā naẓamahu al-shāʿir al-ijtimāʿī al-kabīr Maʿrūf Efendi al-Ruṣāfī al-Baghdādī*, edited by Muḥī al-Dīn al-Khayyāṭ and Muṣṭafā Ghalāyīnī, Bayrūt: al-Maktaba al-Ahliyya, 1910 (1328 aH). According to the introduction by the editor, the Dīwān was compiled during a visit of al-Ruṣāfī to Beirut.

Facsimiles were produced by scanning the copy found at the Orient-Institut Beirut.

Qaṣāʾid found in periodical editions are imported into this edition by way of `<xi:include>`.
